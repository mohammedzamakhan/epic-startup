# Scheduled Jobs

Epic Stack runs control-plane maintenance on a schedule without a separate job
runner like Trigger.dev. A lightweight **Cloudflare Worker** (`apps/jobs-cron`)
fires cron triggers that POST to authenticated routes on the **App primary
instance**. The App holds the control-plane SQLite database, so the actual work
always runs where the database lives.

## Architecture

```
Cloudflare Cron (apps/jobs-cron)
        │  POST + Bearer INTERNAL_COMMAND_TOKEN
        ▼
App instance (Cloudflare Workers)
        ▼
/resources/jobs/* route handlers
        │
        ▼
Control-plane SQLite (audit logs, MCP tokens, GDPR requests, …)
```

Job routes live under `apps/app/app/routes/resources+/jobs.*.ts` and share the
auth guard in `apps/app/app/utils/internal-command-auth.server.ts` (same pattern
as the Admin cache route).

## Cron schedules (UTC)

| Cron        | Route                                       | Purpose                                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `0 2 * * *` | `/resources/jobs/audit-log-archival`        | Archive old audit logs                         |
| `0 3 * * *` | `/resources/jobs/mcp-token-cleanup`         | Remove expired MCP tokens                      |
| `0 4 * * *` | `/resources/jobs/gdpr-erasure`              | Process pending GDPR erasures                  |
| `0 4 * * *` | `/resources/jobs/voice-retention`           | Delete expired call recordings and caller data |
| `0 5 * * *` | `/resources/jobs/form-submission-retention` | Not scheduled (see below)                      |

The hourly `0 * * * *` trigger runs the tenant engagement sync. The Workers free
plan allows five cron triggers per Worker, so new daily jobs share an existing
trigger (each job is still its own request with its own error logging).

Form-submission retention (delete regional website-form submissions older than
365 days) is mapped in `JOB_ROUTES`, but `0 5 * * *` is not in
`apps/jobs-cron/wrangler.jsonc`, so it does not run. Add that trigger only when
you want old form submissions deleted.

## Secrets and configuration

| Variable                 | Where                           | Purpose                                           |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `INTERNAL_COMMAND_TOKEN` | App, tenant-api, jobs-cron      | Bearer token for internal POST routes (≥16 chars) |
| `APP_BASE_URL`           | `apps/jobs-cron/wrangler.jsonc` | Base URL the worker POSTs to (staging/production) |

Set the worker secret (must match App):

```bash
cd apps/jobs-cron
npx wrangler secret put INTERNAL_COMMAND_TOKEN
```

Update `APP_BASE_URL` in `wrangler.jsonc` for each environment before deploy.

## Deployment

The `deploy-jobs-cron` GitHub Actions job deploys when `apps/jobs-cron/**`
changes. Locally:

```bash
cd apps/jobs-cron
npm run dev      # wrangler dev with cron simulation
npm run deploy   # production deploy
```

See also [deployment checklist](./deployment-checklist.md) and
[secrets](./secrets.md).

## One-off ops scripts

Some maintenance tasks are **not** on the cron schedule and are run manually
from the repo root:

| Script / npm command               | Purpose                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run audit:integrity-backfill` | Backfill HMAC integrity hashes on existing audit logs (dry-run by default; pass `--apply` to `npx tsx scripts/audit-integrity-backfill.ts`) |
| `scripts/transfer-s3-files.ts`     | Copy objects between S3 buckets when onboarding BYO storage (see [organization S3 storage](./organization-s3-storage.md))                   |

GDPR erasure processing previously lived in `scripts/process-gdpr-requests.mjs`;
that flow is now the `/resources/jobs/gdpr-erasure` cron route.

## Storage migration (Cloudflare Workflow)

When an org admin enables BYO S3 or changes buckets, existing note/comment media
can be copied in the background:

1. Admin saves S3 settings (optionally checks **Migrate existing org media**) or
   clicks **Migrate existing media** on the settings page.
2. App creates a `StorageMigration` row and POSTs to
   `JOBS_CRON_WORKER_URL/workflows/storage-migration/start`.
3. `StorageMigrationWorkflow` on `apps/jobs-cron` loops:
   - `POST /resources/storage/migration/:id/batch` — App copies the next batch
     server-side (then deletes each object from the source bucket), and
     **finalizes** the migration (`completed` / `failed`) when no objects remain
   - On unrecoverable workflow errors, `POST .../complete` marks the migration
     `failed`

Secrets stay on the App (Cloudflare D1/Workers); the Worker never stores org
credentials.

**App env:** `JOBS_CRON_WORKER_URL` (Worker public URL — `http://localhost:8787`
in dev; production: `https://jobs.<your-apex-domain>` on a custom domain).

## Video note media (no background jobs)

Note video **posters** and **hover preview clips** are generated **on demand**
via
[Cloudflare Media Transformations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/transform-images/transform-videos/)
(`/cdn-cgi/media/`), not ffmpeg or async workers.

1. The App exposes `/resources/videos/source?objectKey=…`, which proxies the
   org's object from Cloudflare R2 or custom S3 (HEAD + Range support).
2. URL helpers in `@repo/common` build transform URLs when
   `MEDIA_TRANSFORM_BASE_URL` is set on the App.
3. The `VideoPoster` component shows a frame poster and plays a short silent
   clip on hover.

**Production requirements:**

- App hostname must be **Cloudflare-proxied** (orange cloud).
- Enable **Media Transformations** on that zone.
- Set `MEDIA_TRANSFORM_BASE_URL=https://app.yourdomain.com` on the App
  (Cloudflare secret).

Leave `MEDIA_TRANSFORM_BASE_URL` empty in local dev; the UI falls back to direct
source URLs.
